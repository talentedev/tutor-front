    </header>
    <p class="content">By registering as a tutor with learnt.io (the "website"), you (“Tutor”) agree that the following
        terms and conditions will govern all payments made to you by students through the Learnt system.</p>
    
    <h3>Conditions for payment for student lessons</h3> 
    <p class="content">Learnt is a marketplace for those seeking tutoring services to connect with those seeking to
        provide tutoring services. Learnt also provides a service to its users whereby payments will be distributed to
        tutors that originate from their students. However, if any of the following conditions are not met and Learnt
        becomes unable to collect your payment from the parent, student, or other type of account-holder (collectively,
        "student") to whom you gave a lesson, your payment may not be successfully collected, processed and distributed
        to you:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li><span class="underlined">The information pertaining to the lesson is accurate</span>. This includes the start and end time, location, duration, subject and student name. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Tutor and student, the start and end time will be considered to be the times of the actual tutoring lesson, not arrival and departure times to and from the tutoring location.</li> 
        <li><span class="underlined">Prior to each lesson being given, the student has on file with Learnt a valid form of payment</span>. This includes a valid credit/debit card or other form of payment acceptable to Learnt.</li>
        <li><span class="underlined">The Tutor's services are instructive and constitute learning, not cheating</span>. More specifically, the tutor is not to complete assignments, write papers, take quizzes or otherwise do work on the student's behalf. Further, the services that the Tutor offers must not violate the academic honesty policy or other conduct policies of the student's school, university, academic institution or workplace.</li>
        <li><span class="underlined">The Tutor must mark the lesson as “completed” in the Learnt system within 24 hours of the lesson occurring</span>. The students may request a refund or otherwise challenge “completed” status.  If a lesson is not entered as “completed” by the Tutor within this 24-hour window, this may result in non-payment or delayed payment.  Also, the students have an opportunity to request a refund or otherwise challenge the “completed” status of a lesson, in which case the payment for such lesson will be considered “in-dispute”.  In such instances, Learnt will (i) investigate all such “in-dispute” payments, (ii) resolve any such situation in its sole and absolute discretion, and (iii) process payment(s) (if any) accordingly.</li>
        <li><span class="underlined">Prior to a lesson being given, the tutor has received a Learnt notification that the lesson has been accepted and confirmed by the student, and the lesson is not cancelled by the student more than 24 hours prior to the time of the lesson</span>.  If the lesson is cancelled by the student less than 24 hours prior to the confirmed start of the lesson, Tutor may receive payment pursuant to Learnt’s 24-hour cancellation policy.  This will be determined by Learnt, in its sole discretion, based on its investigation of any such instance of cancellation, any “in-dispute” amounts, any excuses for cancellation provided by the student, and any other factors deemed relevant by Learnt in its sole discretion. Naturally, if the lesson is cancelled by the Tutor, there will also be no payment for any such cancelled lesson. (Moreover, please note Learnts’ 24-hour cancellation policy with respect to cancellations by Tutors – a cancellation by the Tutor, providing less than 24-hours’ notice to the student, will be investigated by Learnt and may result in disciplinary action, including suspension of the Tutor’s account.)</li>
        <li><span class="underlined">The Tutor does not collect or request payment directly from the student by cash, check or otherwise (e.g., Paypal, Venmo, Square, etc.) for the lesson.</span></li>
        <li><span class="underlined">The Tutor schedules all lessons with Learnt students solely and exclusively through the Learnt platform and does not communicate with any such Learnt students regarding scheduling through personal e-mail, text, IM, or telephone.</span>  See Independent Tutor Agreement, para. 6 (Non-circumvention): Tutors may not provide lessons to Learnt students outside of the Learnt platform.</li>
        <li><span class="underlined">The Tutor is over 18 years old and is eligible to work in the United States.</span></li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Timing and delivery of payments</h3>
    <p class="content">If all the <b>Conditions for payment for student lessons</b> (as set forth above) are met, Tutors can expect to receive their funds according to the following.  The Tutors will be paid through Stripe in accordance with Stripe’s applicable rules, policies, and procedures as well as the applicable processing fees charged by Stripe (and by relevant banks, if any). Accordingly, the Tutors must provide their accurate bank account and routing numbers and any and all other information required or requested by Learnt and/or Stripe in order to process payments to the Tutors. Generally, payments are expected to be processed within one week, but Learnt does not guarantee the timing of payments, as bank processing times vary.</p>
    
    <h3>Social Security number requirement</h3>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Prior to payments made in an amount of greater than $50, cumulatively, tutors must submit to Learnt a valid Social Security Number ("SSN"). Such payments may be withheld by Learnt until the SSN is received, and the payments will be released with the next scheduled payment.</li>
        <li>Tutors may use an Employer Identification Number ("EIN") issued by the Internal Revenue Service in place of a SSN for payment reporting purposes only. To use an EIN, a tutor must complete, sign and submit to Learnt an IRS Form W-9.  However, please note that, as an independent contractor, each Tutor is solely responsible for filing and paying his or her taxes, and complying with any applicable tax laws (e.g., federal, state, local, self-employment, etc.) in the Tutor’s home jurisdiction.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Calculation of tutor payment amounts</h3>
    <ol type="a">
        <li><span class="underlined">Tutors set their own hourly rate and may change it at any time.</span></li>
        <li><span class="underlined">Commission and referral fees</span>. Learnt will charge a commission of 30% (the “Commission”) on every payment for a lesson arranged between a student and a Tutor through the Learnt, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.
            <ol type="i">
                <li>If a Tutor invites a student to the Learnt through the Tutor's direct referral link on Learnt, and the student schedules, confirms and completes one or more lessons through Learnt with that Tutor, then Learnt will not charge the Commission for such lessons, and the Tutor will be paid for such lessons at the Tutor’s agreed hourly rate (less any payment processing fees).</li>
                <li>If a Tutor invites a student to Learnt, and that student works with another Tutor on the Learnt platform, then the referring Tutor will be paid $50 by Learnt, once that student has scheduled, confirmed and completed 10 hours of lessons with any such Tutor on the Learnt platform.</li>
                <li>If a Tutor invites another tutor to join Learnt, the referring Tutor will be paid $50 by Learnt, once the invited Tutor has completed 10 hours of lessons through the Learnt platform.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><span class="underlined">Non-tutoring charges should be incorporated into the hourly rate</span>. Travel, parking, prep time or other expenses that you wish to defray to the customer must first be agreed to by the student. The mechanism to assess these charges is to adjust your hourly rate. Under no circumstances should the Tutor receive payments directly from the student.</li> 
    </ol>
